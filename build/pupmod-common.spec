- This is a major overhaul of the common module based on the
  elimination of the sec module and the move to Hiera.
- common::initlog has been removed
- common::acpid was moved to its own module
- All common includes should be performed via Hiera (or your own ENC)
- common::pre has been removed
- common::host_conf::conf has been moved to common::host_conf and the
  following changes were made:
  - multi is now 'on' by default
  - spoof is now set to 'warn' by default
  - reorder is now set to 'on' by default
  - trim must now be an array
- Most templates were reorganized into spaces that map directly to
  their OS targets
- The localusers script now has the array injected directly into the
  template.
- common::resolv::nameservers must be an array
- common::inittab was removed and replaced with logic in
  common::runlevel since inittab is no longer really used.
- RHEL 5 logic was removed
- common::nsswitch was rewritten to be more flexible
- common::resolv was cleaned up and the common::resolv::conf define
  was rolled into common::resolv
- Moved the common::swappiness::conf define to common::swappiness
- Moved common::sysconfig::init::conf to common::sysconfig::init
- Moved common::yum::pre into common::yum and added configurability
- Moved the old elinks module into common::base_apps
- Incorporated sec::login_defs and allowed for overriding all
  variables

  kernel modules.
- common::set_ftpusers has been replaced by common::ftpusers
- Added common::profile_settings for managing settings in
  /etc/profile.d. These have been renamed from 'local.*' to 'simp.*'
  so you'll need to remove old '/etc/profile.d/local.*' files manually
  if you don't want them to apply.
- Added management of the root user's core attributes (not password).
- Moved the mountpoint mangling from sec into common as
  common::secure_mountpoints.

  uses the first to validate the entries in the second.

* Wed Jul 31 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0.0-0
- Added the custom function 'validate_net_list' which validates that a
  passed array of IP addresses/netmasks is valid. Takes an optional
  regex that allows for specific entries to be ignored.
- Added the custom type simp_file_line which is an enhanced version of the
  Puppet Labs stdlib file_line function.
- Added the options of 'prepend' and 'deconflict' which allow for prepending
  lines and avoiding conflicts with 'file' resources respectively.
- Also ensure that non-avoided conflicts fail with a descriptive error and that
  related files are autorequired since you may be creating them elsewhere.
- The common::resolv class was unhappy with the default case of
  $::named::chroot not being defined (even though that's exactly what we
  wanted) so we now check to see if Class['named'] is defined before calling
  the variable.
- Two utility facts were added:
    - 'array_include':  Determine if an array contains another array OR string.
    - 'array_union':    Return the union of two arrays or array and string.

* Tue Jun 18 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> 2.1.2-1
- Updated the resolv.pp file to allow users to select whether or not they wish
  to act as a caching nameserver explicitly. This is fundamentally for
  supporting the use of dnsmasq, or another nameserver that we don't currently
  support.
- Added a variable to resolv.pp allowing users to opt out of having puppet
  automatically configure their system as a SIMP DNS server if the server IP is
  in the passed list of nameservers. This is particularly relevant if you want
  your server to have a different configuration than is activated by default.

* Tue Jan 08 2013 Maintenance
2.1.1-4
- Added the Fedora 16 GPG keys to the list of keys in local.repo since we now
  include packages from the distro by default.
- Added functionality to enable handling more than 15 ports in a single
  multiport rule in the base templates and the optimization code. The
  same technique was used in both places.
- Consolidated the template for TCP and UDP services to reduce code
  repitition.
- The replaced the iptables_running and iptables_saved facts with a
  fact that does a bit more work to determine if we actually need a
  restart.

* Mon Oct 22 2012 Maintenance
2.1.1-3
- Updated the 'inactive' variable in useradd.pp to be 35 instead of
  -1.
- Cleaned up the way ipv6_enabled works to be a bit less error prone.

* Tue Sep 18 2012 Maintenance
2.1.1-2
- Updated all references of /etc/modprobe.conf to /etc/modprobe.d/00_simp_blacklist.conf
  as modprobe.conf is now deprecated.

- The nightly cron job was malformed an not functioning. This has been
  resolved.
- Added a function 'simp_version' to provide the version of SIMP
  running on the server.
- Made 'ktune' a class at common::ktune so that users can call it if they want
  it and not have to rely on magic under common::sysctl::net. This does mean
  that you must now explicitly call 'common::ktune' if you want to use it.
- Updated to ensure that sysctl calls only present in RHEL5 work properly in
  RHEL6.
- Now use the Puppet Labs stdlib function 'file_line' instead of
  'functions::append_if_no_such_line'

- Updated to not manage ktune if ktune option not set
- Updated the template to make the updated common::yum::update_schedule
  actually work.

- Added common::at to manage /etc/at.allow
- Added common::cron to manage /etc/cron.allow
- Modified the common::yum::update_schedule function to allow for disabling
  repos from the nightly cron job

* Fri May 14 2010 Maintenance
0.1-35
- Added proper include for 'sysctl'
- Removed ELinks from the list of installed default applications.

* Wed May 12 2010 Maintenance
0.1-34
- Removed the has_service_acpid fact since we're now including it in the common
  applications.
- Added the has_clustering fact and tied the start of acpid to whether or not
  clustering is running on your system. Acpid should not run if clustering is
  enabled.

* Fri May 07 2010 Maintenance
0.1-33
- Added acpid to the list of installed/running default applications.

* Thu Apr 29 2010 Maintenance
0.1-32
- Changed operatingsystemrelease to operatingsystemmajrelease since RHEL5.5 shows as 5.5
 and not 5.

* Wed Mar 17 2010 Maintenance
0.1-31
- A massive refactor of the pupmod-common codebase. This is the beginning of a
  complete code overhaul.
- The nightly yum update job is now silent by default so that you don't get
  daily logs of OK behaviour. Stderr will still be reported. This can be
  configured through the associated define.

* Tue Feb 23 2010 Maintenance
0.1-30
- Fixed a bug in passgen that would set the directory permissions to 640 instead
  of 750.
- Added dependency on pupmod-site.

* Thu Jan 28 2010 Maintenance
0.1-29
- Added randomization to the yum cron job with a default of 5 minutes.
- Cleaned up passgen and ensured that some edge cases were accounted for.

* Wed Jan 06 2010 Maintenance
0.1-28
- Added "common::sysctl::net" and "common::sysctl::net::advanced" which provide
  a set of useful network tuning parameters.
  - common::sysctl::net sets safe kernel tuning parameters

        net.ipv4.tcp_no_metrics_save = 1

  - common::sysctl::net::advanced sets an unsafe tuning parameter that may be
    useful for heavily loaded systems.
        net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1

* Wed Dec 30 2009 Maintenance
0.1-27
  - Modified the passgen function to now have the following properties:
  - passgen(unique_id) -> Returns the stored password for 'unique_id' if there
    is one, if there is not, it generates a new password and returns that.
  - All other properties remain the same.

* Tue Dec 15 2009 Maintenance
0.1-26
- Added a section to add the yum-skip-broken package to the system if using RHEL
  < 5.3
- $dns_search and $dns_servers are now applied in the order that it is provided
  in the vars.pp file.  However, they are also now *space delimited* lists.
- Added a function, passgen(unique_id, password_length) to generate random
  passwords for use at a site.
- Added facts for $defaultgateway and $defaultgatewayiface.  They do what you
  would expect and return 'unknown' if there is no default gateway.

* Tue Oct 13 2009 Maintenance
0.1-25
- Fixed the yum-cron.erb template to work around Puppet Redmine Bug #2127.

* Thu Oct 8 2009 Maintenance
0.1-24
- Now include the 'common::yum' class by default.

* Tue Oct 6 2009 Maintenance
0.1-23
- Added a custom fact 'has_service_acpid' to determine whether or not the system
  has the acpid service.  This was mainly added for pupmod-gfs2.
- Added the ruby-shadow package as a base application so that users can now use
  the password feature of the native 'user' puppet type.

* Thu Oct 1 2009 Maintenance
0.1-22
- Added a custom fact 'runlevel' to obtain the current run level of the system.
- Nixed the spurious error spawned on non-IPv6 systems using the ipv6_enabled
  fact.
